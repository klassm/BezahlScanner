# BezahlScanner

Scan QR-Codes for payments comfortably on your Android phone. When logging in to your favorite bank account in Chrome, just click on the payment you want to make. All the payment data will be put into the respective form field, so that you don't need to care about typos or so.

## Android

You can find the Android app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=li.klass.bezahlscanner). Make sure to also install the [zxing Barcode scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android), which is used for scanning QR codes, and [Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs), used for data persistence.

Currently, QR codes from [GiroCode](https://www.girocode.de) and [BezahlCode](http://www.bezahlcode.de/) are supported. To try out the app, BezahlCode offers a simple [tool](http://www.bezahlcode.de/funktionsweise/) on their web page to generate test QR codes.

## Chrome Plugin

You can find the the Chrome plugin in the [Chrome store web page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bezahlscanner/aebjeejojgchggdnbihchgfcjnbnaahm).

When opening up the transaction form on your favorite bank's web page (currently supported: Sparkasse, ComDirect, DAB and Diba), the plugin will offer a link called "BezahlScanner". When clicking the link you will see a table of your most recently scanned QR codes. Just click on on of them and your transaction data will be magically filled in.

## Data Privacy

BezahlScanner will never access any private data except for the purpose of reading and saving data from and to Google Drive. If you don't believe me check out the source code or sniff the network traffic!
